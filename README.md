# MMA-Spacejam:

 This is the official repository for the Make My Appointment Project by Team-Internal Server Error for Spacejam.
 
# Problem Statement:

Ever since the COVID-19 Pandemic happened, people are getting more and more concerned about their well-being and health. 
Testing labs for various diseases are flooded with loads of appointments and due to lack of proper management of the appointments, applicants end up waiting a lot especially during rush hours.

# Proposed Solution:

Our solution aims at developing a robust portal that will give the user multiple options for different types of tests with complete details of all slots for a particular date including their vacancies. We will be filtering testing centers and also the distance from the user using geolocation APIs. The users can select a centre based on the reviews and ratings given by other customers.

Using this, the testing labs will also have a single place to check in with all their appointments for all the tests of the day as well as sending out the results through email. They can also provide the details of the facilities they provide.

# Facilities Provided:

 -> User and Test Centre Registration and Login<br>
 -> Validation using OTP<br>
 -> Test Centre Appointment booking using Geolocation Here API to show the customers the nearest test centre offering the tests wanted by the user on a particular date and slot<br>
 -> Viewing history of all appointments by User<br>
 -> Test Centre have the option of sending all the results using email, viewing all appointments and also cancelling<br>
 -> They can also add facilities for other tests<br>
 -> Review and Rating collection from past customers<br>
 -> Sentimental Analysis of the Reviews using NLP SVC Model for informing users what opinion people have of that test centre for better decision making<br>
